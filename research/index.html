<div class="research">
  <p>My research has been mostly in low-level image processing applications, such as image denoising. I am currently working on a project to 
  bound how well we can denoise geometric features of an image, such as curvature, with respect to PSNR. Current code and work related to this project can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/BradySheehan/optimality_experiment">github project page</a>.</p>
  
  <p>A list of the <a href="bradysheehan.github.io/talks">talks</a> I have given is also available.</p>
