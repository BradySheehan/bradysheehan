<h1>Research</h1>
  <p>My research has been mostly in low-level image processing applications, such as image denoising. I am currently working on a project to 
  bound how well we can denoise geometric features of an image, such as level-line curvature, with respect to PSNR. Current code and work related to this project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/BradySheehan/optimality_experiment">github project page</a>.</p>
