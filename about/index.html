<div class="about">
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> Currently I am studying mathematics and computer science at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA. I love Pittsburgh and have had an awesome experience studying at Duquesne the last three years. </p>

	<p> I love to read and occasionally answer questions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Brady-Sheehan-1">Quora</a> and I often peruse <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/3676509/brady-sheehan?tab=accounts" >stackexchange</a>. </p>
