	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> Currently I am studying mathematics and computer science at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA. I love Pittsburgh and have had an awesome experience studying at Duquesne the last three years. </p>

	<p>My favorite hobby is playing billiards. I've played at several pool halls across the state and some of my favorites are listed below (in no particular order)! </p>

	You might see me there sometime! I've been playing with the same cue since I was 13 years old. I have a J. Pechauer Cue (more specifically the <a href="http://pechauer.com/retired-cues">2005 Professional Series PS09 </a>). I love this cue and never plan to replace it. In my senior year of high school I bought an <a href="https://www.obcues.com/products/Original-OB%252d2-Shaft.html"> original OB-2 low-deflection shaft </a> to use with the butt of my Pechauer and really enjoy playing with it.

	<p>I also have a <a href="http://www.atv.com/specs/polaris/sport/2005/predator/500.html">2005 Polaris Predator 500 ATV</a> that I love to ride with friends and family. One of our favorite places to ride during the summer is at the <a href="http://www.rameyfirecompany.com/poker-runs.html">Ramey Poker Run</a>.</p>
