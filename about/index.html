<div class="about">
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I am a recent computer science and mathematics graduate of <a href="http://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/liberal-arts/academic-programs/math-and-computer-science">Duquesne University</a> in Pittsburgh, PA. I love Pittsburgh and have had an awesome experience studying at Duquesne the last three years. </p>


	<p> I enjoy playing billiards with my friends, creating things like a this website and a <a href="">custom digital pinball machine</a>, and being outdoors. </p>

	<p> Some of my professional interests include robotics, data science, general software engineering, and helping others achieve their goals. </p>

	<p> I love to read and occasionally answer questions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Brady-Sheehan-1">Quora</a> and I often peruse <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/3676509/brady-sheehan?tab=accounts" >stackexchange</a>. </p>
