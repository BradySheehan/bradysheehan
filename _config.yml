defaults:
-
  scope:
    path: "" # an empty string here means all files in the project
    type: "posts"
  values:
    layout: "default"

#    Now, this will only set the layout for files where the type is posts. 
#    The different types that are available to you are pages, posts, drafts or 
#    any collection in your site. While type is optional, you must specify a value 
#    for path when creating a scope/values pair.

  scope:
    path: "projects"
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "project"
    author: "Brady Sheehan"

#    With these defaults, all posts would use the my-site layout. Any html files 
#    that exist in the projects/ folder will use the project layout, if it exists. 
#    Those files will also have the page.author liquid variable set to Mr. Hyde.
